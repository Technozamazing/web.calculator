Code Overview:
HTML
The main structure of the calculator is defined in the index.html file. It consists of buttons for numbers and operators, and an input field for displaying the result.

CSS
Basic styles for layout and responsiveness are written in the style.css file. You can customize the appearance by modifying this file.

JavaScript
The core logic of the calculator is handled by script.js. This file processes user input and performs arithmetic operations.


Here’s an overview of how the code works:
-> Button clicks are captured, and the input is updated accordingly.
-> The "=" button evaluates the expression and displays the result.
-> The "AC" button resets the calculator, while the "DEL" button removes the last digit.
